## Introduction
An AI-powered shopping assistant application that helps users recognize products from images, ask questions about those products, retrieve purchase links, and fetch relevant information from Wikipedia. The app is available in two modes: a manual app interface and a fully automated multi-agentic chatbot system.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 1. 🖼️ Product Recognition from Images
- Upload an image of a product
- The system uses computer vision and multimodal AI to identify the product name and details

### 2. ❓ Product Q&A
- Ask questions about the product
- The chatbot or app uses LLMs to answer your doubts in natural language

### 3. 🔗 Shopping Link Finder
- Automatically fetches direct shopping links from platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, etc.
- Helps you compare and buy products easily

### 4. 🌐 Wikipedia Info Retrieval
- Fetches general and encyclopedic knowledge about the product from Wikipedia
- Helpful for background or historical information
## 🧠Technologies and Frameworks Used
